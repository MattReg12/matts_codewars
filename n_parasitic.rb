An n-parasitic number (in base 10) is a positive natural number which can be multiplied
by n by moving the rightmost digit of its decimal representation to the front. Here n is
itself a single-digit positive natural number. In other words, the decimal representation
undergoes a right circular shift by one place. For example, 4 â€¢ 128205 = 512820, so 128205
is 4-parasitic
